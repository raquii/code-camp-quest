# CodeCamp Quest

__CodeCamp Quest__ is a mini-simulation game built with React.

The game follows a student developer as they attempt to complete their coding assignments before the days end while juggling the needs of their dog.

## General Information

I created this game as my React project for FlatIron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp. The project makes use of both React and Redux. In developing it, I also created my own custom React hooks, and used a good amount  of CSS tricks to facilitate gameplay. 

It is, obviously, heavily inspired by my own day-to-day experience as a young developer with two needy dogs whom I love very much. â™¥ 

You can read more about my experience building the project on my blog: [here](https://dev.to/raquii/using-two-dimensional-arrays-to-build-a-walkable-game-map-in-react-22e7).

## Room for Improvement

- Gameplay is thin. Add some additional interactivety when completing homework assignments to add greater depth to gameplay and increase replayability.
- The dog currently is always pinned at the hip of the character.
- Fine tune map bounds for more realistic experience.
- Add potential for mobile gameplay
